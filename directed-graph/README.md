### Directed Graph

- createVertex - Creates a new vertex with the given ID.
- addVertex - Adds a vertex with the given ID to the graph.
- containsVertex - Checks if the graph contains a vertex with the given ID.
- getVerticesData - Returns data associated with all vertices in the graph.
- getVertexIncomeNeighbors - Returns vertices with incoming edges from a given vertex.
- getVertexOutcomeNeighbors - Returns vertices with outgoing edges from a given vertex.
- getVertexCount - Returns the number of vertices in the graph.
- removeVertex - Removes a vertex from the graph.
- createEdge - Creates a new directed edge between two vertices with optional data.
- addEdge - Adds a directed edge between two vertices in the graph.
- getEdgeData - Returns data associated with a directed edge between two vertices.
- containsEdge - Checks if the graph contains a directed edge between two vertices.
- removeEdge - Removes a directed edge between two vertices from the graph.
- freeEdgeData - Frees memory associated with edge data.
- freeGraph - Frees memory associated with the graph and its vertices.
- isEmpty - Checks if the graph is empty (contains no vertices).
- size - Returns the number of vertices in the graph.
