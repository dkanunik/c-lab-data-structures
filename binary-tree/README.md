- destroy - Destroy the binary tree and free all allocated memory.
- insert - Insert a new node with a given value into the binary tree.
- size - Get the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- height - Calculate the height of the binary tree.
- get_min - Get the minimum value node in the binary tree.
- get_max - Get the maximum value node in the binary tree.
- clear - Clear all nodes from the binary tree while keeping the structure intact.
- remove - Remove a node with a given value from the binary tree.
- is_empty - Check if the binary tree is empty.
- search - Check if a node with a given value is in the binary tree.
- traverse_preorder - Traverse the binary tree in preorder (root, left, right) and perform an operation on each node.
- traverse_inorder - Traverse the binary tree in inorder (left, root, right) and perform an operation on each node.
- traverse_postorder - Traverse the binary tree in postorder (left, right, root) and perform an operation on each node.
